# Sales-Analytics

The provided Python code performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a retail sales dataset. Here's a concise summary of the code:

Import Libraries:

Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn are imported for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis.
Load Dataset:

The retail sales dataset is loaded from the specified path, and the first few rows are displayed.
Data Cleaning:

The data type of the 'Total Amount' column is checked, and if needed, the column is converted to numeric using pd.to_numeric.
Descriptive statistics are computed using describe() to gain insights into the data.
Time Series Analysis:

The 'Date' column is converted to a datetime format.
Sales trends over time are visualized using a line plot.
Customer and Product Analysis:

Customer demographics, specifically gender distribution, are computed.
Product analysis is performed by grouping data based on the 'Product Category' and calculating the total sales for each category.
Visualization:

A bar chart is created to visualize total sales by product category.
Recommendations:

The code includes a comment placeholder to provide actionable recommendations based on insights gained from the EDA. This is where you can add specific recommendations.
Save Cleaned Dataset:

The cleaned dataset is saved to a CSV file if needed (the line is commented out in the provided code).
In summary, this code demonstrates a thorough exploratory analysis of a retail sales dataset, including data loading, cleaning, descriptive statistics, time series analysis, customer demographics, product analysis, and visualization. The analysis aims to provide actionable recommendations for business insights.The provided Python code performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a retail sales dataset.
